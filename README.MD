## Usage
1. Start the api server:

```

open http://localhost:8000/docs to see the api dashboard.

2. run the api through ngrok to make it public:
```bash
ngrok http 8000
```
> **Note:** This has to run in a terminal session after running the api server(step 1). Since by default the api server runs on port 8000, the ngrok command will expose the api server to the internet.

> **Note:** Note the ngrok link that is generated. Thats the public link to the api server.
